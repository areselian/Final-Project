# Using Machine Learning for Diagnostics 

Data Sets: 
Numeric Values https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data
Images https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images

The aim of this project is to compare machine learning models on numeric data vs images, to decide which tool has the highest accuracy in automated cancer classification. 

For the image analysis, our aim is to create a model that predicts whether the image represents cancerous cells (1) or non-cancerous cells (0). For the numeric data, the predictor category is benign versus malignant, based on features such as the cell area, smoothness, texture, etc. 

Currently, our numeric data classifier has an accuracy of ~96% and our image classifier has an accuracy of 85%.
