Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

Data Sets
Images https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images
Numeric Values https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

Our aim is to compare machine learning models on images versus numeric data to see which is the best tool to automate cancerous classification. 

For the image analysis, our aim is to create a model that predicts whether the image represents cancerous cells (1) or non-cancerous cells (0). For the numeric data, the predictor category is benign versus malignant, based on features such as the area, smoothness, texture, etc. 

Currently, our numeric data classifier has an accuracy of ~96% and our image classifier has an accuracy of 85%.
